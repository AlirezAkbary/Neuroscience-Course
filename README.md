# Telepathy-Neuroscience
This is my results for an experiment we designed in order to check whether telepathy exists among close people, which is an important question to think about as it can play a huge role in the mind-body debate, the famous controversial topic in neuroscience. The report is available in the manuscript. This is proposed as a project for the course Foundations of Neuroscience.
